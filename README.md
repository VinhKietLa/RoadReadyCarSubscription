# Road Ready Car Subscription

## Description

I created a fully responsive website mockup for a car subscription service. The purpose of this project was to get more familar with ReactJS and also TailWindCSS as well as creating an example site that could be used and worked on in the real world.

## Installation and Setup Instructions:

- Clone github repository `https://github.com/VinhKietLa/RoadReadyCarSubscription.git`
- run `NPM i`
- run `NPM start` within the src folder to start the application.

## Features

- Fully responsive
- Custom navbar
- Use of props for car information between pages.

## Challenges and Learning

- It was my first time using TailwindCSS, so it was initially challenging to understand how it works in order to use it effectively.
- ReactJS useEffects and useStates, this project helped me to develop my understanding of these two react features.

## Tech stack

- React Router Dom
- ReactJS CreateApp
- TailwindCSS
- Font awesome
- Figma
